## Description
The idea is about wirelessly charging a battery operated device, such as mobile phone, while it is in use, using the various energy sources supplied by the nature. A device need to be developed in the form of a wind chill, which can be hanged at a fixed location in the garden or house balcony. The purpose of this device is to collect energies from various sources such as (Vibrator, Solar, Wind, Light, Sound etc), convert into single electrical signals and supply power to the battery terminal.
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method for wirelessly charging a mobile terminal using electromagnetic induction between a first coil included in a charging pad and a second coil included in the mobile terminal includes: detecting a location of the mobile terminal on the charging pad; moving the first coil to correspond to the detected location of the mobile terminal; and supplying power to the first coil and charging a battery.
It must contain a solar plates on top to generate solar energy.
It must also contain a small fan, which will automatically rotate when the wind blows and generates wind energy.
It must also contain a photodiode that can detect light and convert light energy into electric energy.
It must also contain a transducer that can convert sound energy into electrical energy.
The device should be connected to a spring, and should be able to generate vibrations when the spring oscillates. This vibration can be converted to electrical energy.
The device could be a wind-chill type hanging that can be hanged in Garden or Balcony.
The device should also contain a small USB port, which can be connected to computer or any device to receive the charge directly.
The device should be able to capture all these energy sources and convert into electrical signals.
The device should also contain a wireless charging interface and should be able to transmit electrical signals to any other device, which is kept with in the range of 10-20 meters.
The device should be able to transmit charge to any battery operated product that supports wireless charging capabilities.
