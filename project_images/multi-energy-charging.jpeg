It must contain a solar plates on top to generate solar energy.
It must also contain a small fan, which will automatically rotate when the wind blows and generates wind energy.
It must also contain a photodiode that can detect light and convert light energy into electric energy.
It must also contain a transducer that can convert sound energy into electrical energy.
The device should be connected to a spring, and should be able to generate vibrations when the spring oscillates. This vibration can be converted to electrical energy.
